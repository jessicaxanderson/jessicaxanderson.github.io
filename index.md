![Hello!](https://github.com/jessicaxanderson/jessicaxanderson.github.io/blob/main/JessicaAnderson_Headshot%20250.png)
## Jessica Anderson

I design and write about digital art. For the past 5 years, I've directed studios/labs at academic institutions and also [independently](https://www.intooutof.io/). I also tend to give talks, lead workshops, and consult in the area of technology and art. I have an MS in Digital Media and an MA in English. 

At the moment, I serve on the board of Fulton County's Public Art Futures Lab, am a member of the Atlanta Regional Commission's Emerging Technologies Thinktank, and have been working on a generative projection art piece that is integrated into Staib Dance's performance entitled [_Fence_](http://www.staibdance.com/fence ). 

Below, you'll find documentation of my work over the years :)

### Creative Director & Co-Founder, Into Outof Studio, 2017-Now  

I lead the studio's creative strategy, interaction design, and the physical installation of interactive digital artworks. I manage client relationships. We're a small studio in Atlanta, GA specializing in generative projection art and interactive oddities. Our work usually focuses on nature.

It's a data services agency, a job training program, and a research collective in one -- an experimental organization.
